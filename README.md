- you will need to have gradle, i am use v1.6
- open up command prompt, navigate to the folder that has this project, type >> gradle bz
- this will go to http://www.name321.net
- match each character in input-n.txt to 李南
- get the rating, write to output-n.txt
- after that, use sublime text to manipulate output-n.txt to produce each result as a single line
- then again use sublime to extract name with high marks and put to output file like result-high-marks.txt
- NOTES: all the code you need read is in Bz.groovy
- NOTES: Bz.groovy was generated by firefox selenium plugin from selenium.html
- CAUTION: the matching process will fail very often, that is why input was splitted to multiple file for easier processing
